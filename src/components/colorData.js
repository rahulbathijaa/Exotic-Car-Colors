      longerDescription:"Red Ferrari's are the most classic pairing in the supercar. These colors are classics because they outline Ferrari's elegance beautifully, and hold their value well. While Rosso Corsa is the original Ferrari Red, there are multiple shades to choose from from lighter reds like Rosso Dino all the way to darker colors like Rosso Fiorano. Ferrari red has been common as far back as the original GTOs, but is still very common on cars like the LaFerrari, Pista, and 812 Superfast. It has been so famous that its iconic color has made its way into iconic shoe brands like Pumas or Jordans."
